# Side-Projects-Repo
The purpose of this repository is to house some of the side projects that I have attempted in the realm of machine learning and deep learning. I hope to continue to expand on the projects within this repository as I progress through my graduate degree and my career afterwards. These projects are things that I have found fascinating or believe could give me useful experience for the future. 

As a project increases in size, I will move them from here into their own designated private repository.
